# D&D Skill — Command Procedures

Full step-by-step procedures for all `/dm:dnd` slash commands. Load this file at `/dm:dnd load` or before executing any slash command.

> **Path note:** commands below use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` for the skill directory. This file is read verbatim, so that token is **not** auto-expanded here — substitute the absolute skill-dir path (from `SKILL.md`) before running any command, or it will fail with a broken `/scripts/…` path.

## `/dm:dnd new <campaign-name> [theme]`
1. **Session setup — call `AskUserQuestion`** with **two questions**:

   **Q1 *"Display & input mode?"***
   - `No display` → continue without display.
   - `Display (local)` → `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/start-display.sh`, print URL, set `_display_running = true`, then `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --clear`.
   - `Display (LAN)` → `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/start-display.sh --lan`, print both URLs, set `_display_running = true`, then `--clear` as above.
   - `Display + autorun (LAN)` → as **Display (LAN)**, and write `autorun: true` to `state.md → ## Session Flags`.

   **Q2 *"Dice rolls?"*** — set how PC d20s are handled (see SKILL.md "Dice convention"):
   - `Players roll their own` (default) → write `roll_mode: players` to `state.md → ## Session Flags`. You will call for each PC roll and wait — never auto-roll a PC.
   - `DM rolls everything openly` → write `roll_mode: auto`. You resolve PC rolls yourself with full math shown.

   Default to `roll_mode: players` if the question is dismissed.
2. **Ruleset selection (added 2026-05-08).** Ask: *"D&D 5e ruleset for this campaign? **2014** (SRD 5.1, default — full mechanics, classic Player's Handbook structure) or **2024** (SRD 5.2, weapon mastery + origin feats + background ASIs + revised exhaustion)?"* Default to `2014` if no answer or ambiguous. Write the chosen value to `state.md` header line as `**Ruleset:** 2014` or `**Ruleset:** 2024`.

   If 2024 was chosen: verify the dataset exists with `ls ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/data/dnd5e_srd_2024.json`. If missing, run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_srd.py --ruleset 2024` (one-time, ~3 min). Until the dataset exists, lookup-based features will fall back to 2014.
3. `mkdir -p ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/characters`
4. Copy and populate templates from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/` — state.md, world.md, npcs.md, session-log.md. The state.md header keeps the `**Ruleset:**` field set in step 2.
5. Ask: **party size** and **starting level**
6. **Tone/Genre Wizard** — present all four in one message:
   - Tone: `grimdark / dark fantasy / heroic / horror / political / swashbuckling / cosmic`
   - Magic level: `none / low / medium / high`
   - Setting type: `medieval / renaissance / ancient / nautical / underground`
   - Danger level: `lethal / gritty / standard / heroic`
   *(If `[theme]` supplied, pre-fill Tone and ask remaining three. Randomise any blank via dice.py and log `"d6=N → [result]"` in world.md.)*
7. **World Foundations** — geography/biome/climate, magic system, pantheon (2–3 active deities), calendar. Write to `## World Foundations` in world.md. Seed `state.md → ## World State → In-world date`.
8. **Three Truths** — one settlement, one nearby threat, one mystery (with clue trail). Write to respective sections in world.md.
9. **Threat Escalation Arc** — fill the five-stage table in world.md immediately after threat generation. Set current stage to 1. Write `Threat arc stage: 1 — Now` to `state.md → ## World State`.
10. **2 Factions** — archetype, all fields including current activity. Write to `## Factions` in world.md. Write one-line faction states to `state.md → ## World State`.
11. **3 NPCs with relationship web** — full entries (role, stats, demeanor, motivation, secret, speech quirk, faction, current goal, schedule, personality axes). Generate all three first, then fill Relationships (every NPC needs ≥2 links to others). Update index table.
12. **3–5 Quest Seeds** from threat, factions, mystery, NPC motivations. Write to `## Quest Seed Bank` in world.md.
13. **Dynamic Campaign Arc** — auto-generate the arc from all world data just created. Use Opus for this step. Ask: *"Generate a committed narrative arc? [y/n — recommended]"*

   **If yes:** Drawing from theme, threat arc stages, factions, Three Truths, NPC motivations, and quest seeds, derive:
   - **`theme`** — one sentence: what is this story ultimately about? Not the threat — its meaning.
   - **`resolution`** — the committed endpoint shape: if the party succeeds, what's the emotional truth? Keep specific events open; commit to the shape.
   - **Acts 1–3**, each with 2 beats. Each beat has:
     - `label` — a dramatic name
     - `what_changes` — before/after: what's fundamentally different once this lands? **CRITICAL: write this as a CONSEQUENCE, not an event.** A consequence is a state-of-the-world after the beat. An event is one specific thing that happens. Consequences survive when players pre-empt the obvious event delivery; events break and the beat goes stale. Example contrast for a 2b "All Is Lost" beat:
       - ❌ Event-shaped (fragile): *"Vedra's nomination succeeds and she takes the third seat."* If the party flips the clerk, this can't land — beat goes stale.
       - ✅ Consequence-shaped (robust): *"The party experiences a concrete cost from the Kept's escalation that they cannot reverse — a cover blown, an ally compromised, or a position they relied on no longer available."* This survives multiple delivery paths.
     - `world_pressure` — the specific faction or NPC move (naming actual entities from this world) that makes the beat feel inevitable. This MAY be event-shaped — but if the players pre-empt it, you're expected to revise per SKILL.md rule 8 (pre-emption is a revision trigger).
   - **`steering_notes`** — how to reach the first beat without forcing it

   Beat layout:
   - Act 1: **1a Inciting Incident** (the threat becomes personal for the party), **1b Complication** (the problem is bigger or stranger than it first appeared)
   - Act 2: **2a Midpoint Shift** (what the party *thought* they were doing changes), **2b All Is Lost** (a genuine setback — something fails, is lost, or collapses)
   - Act 3: **3a Final Confrontation** (the decisive moment the campaign turns on), **3b Resolution** (what's different about the world and the characters after)

   Write to `state.md → ## Campaign Arc` with `type: dynamic`. Deliver a one-paragraph arc summary to the DM.

   **If no:** Write `type: sandbox` to `## Campaign Arc`. The story remains open-ended with no arc tracking.

14. Write state.md with session count 0, starting location.
15. **Physical dice server check (only if installed).** Skip this step unless the optional dice server is set up: probe with `test -d ~/.dnd-dice || test "$DND_DICE_PHYSICAL" = "1"` and short-circuit out if the test fails. When it passes, run `curl -sf http://localhost:7777/health` (timeout 1s). If it returns OK, fetch the LAN IP with `python3 -c "import socket; s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM); s.connect(('8.8.8.8', 80)); print(s.getsockname()[0]); s.close()"` and announce: *"Dice server is up. Once each player has made a character via `/dm:dnd character new`, they should open `http://<ip>:7777/?player=<pc-name>` on their phone (lowercase, hyphens for spaces) and tap **consecrate** before play starts. NPC/DM rolls auto-resolve on the host."* If unreachable, skip silently.
16. Confirm creation, offer `/dm:dnd character new`.

## Web campaign creation (`/campagna`)

When the display is running, the DM can open `<display URL>/campagna` from any device and create a campaign there instead of in the terminal. The login screen does not link to it: the DM types the address. The page asks for a password first, on every device including this PC. The password is stored only as a salted hash in the runtime dir. Set or change it with `echo <password> | python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/camp_create.py set-password`. A new password logs out every browser, and `clear-password` closes the page. Never write the password into a file or repeat it back.

Claude asks the choices of `/dm:dnd new` one at a time: ruleset, dice, party size, starting level, tone, magic, setting, danger, the DM's wishes, a pitch with settlement, threat and mystery, and whether to have an arc. This Claude has no tools and no files (`claude -p --tools ""`). After the DM confirms, Opus writes `world.md`, then `npcs.md`, then `state.md`. It follows the templates and the `/dm:dnd new` procedure above, which `camp_create.py` reads from this file. The server checks every section before it creates `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<folder>/`.

The display question is skipped, because `/dm:dnd load` asks it. The graph and calendar are also set up at load, as for any campaign. A web-created campaign has no PCs yet: players build them at `/crea`, and the DM imports them with `/dm:dnd character import`.

---

## `/dm:dnd load <campaign-name>`
0. **Pick the campaign if none was named.** If `<campaign-name>` was supplied (or the player clearly named one), use it. Otherwise `ls` the campaigns dir (`~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/` or `$DND_CAMPAIGN_ROOT/campaigns/`) and **call `AskUserQuestion`**: *"Which campaign?"* with the existing campaign names as options (most-recently-played first — sort by `state.md` mtime). The player can pick "Other" to type a name. If there are no campaigns, tell them and offer `/dm:dnd new`.
1. **Session setup — call `AskUserQuestion`** with **three questions** (not typed y/n prompts). List `characters/*.md` first — Q3 needs the PC names.

   **Q1 *"Display & input mode?"***
   - `No display` → continue without display.
   - `Display (local)` → `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/start-display.sh`, print URL, set `_display_running = true`.
   - `Display (LAN)` → `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/start-display.sh --lan`, print both URLs, set `_display_running = true`.
   - `Display + autorun (LAN)` → as **Display (LAN)**, and also write `autorun: true` to `state.md → ## Session Flags`; enter the autorun wait after the recap.

   **Q2 *"Dice rolls?"*** — confirm how PC d20s are handled this session (see SKILL.md "Dice convention"). Pre-fill the recommended option from the existing `roll_mode` in `state.md` if present, else `players`:
   - `Players roll their own` → write `roll_mode: players`. Call for each PC roll and wait — never auto-roll a PC.
   - `DM rolls everything openly` → write `roll_mode: auto`. Resolve PC rolls yourself with full math shown.

   **Q3 *"Who's playing tonight?"*** — skip it when the party has a single PC. Build it from the PCs in `characters/` (the party line in `state.md`):
   - **2–4 PCs** → `multiSelect: true`, one option per PC (label = character name, description = player name if known). Selected = present; the rest are absent.
   - **5+ PCs** → single-select: `Everyone` / `Someone's missing`. On the second, ask in one plain line which PCs are missing.

   Write the answer to `state.md → ## Session Flags` as `absent: <comma-separated PC names>`, or `absent: none` when everyone is there. This **replaces** any previous value — absence is decided fresh at every load, never carried over. Absent PCs are **benched** for the whole session (see SKILL.md → *Absent players*): left off the sidebar, never in a scene or a roll call, not counted for encounter balance — but they still receive every XP award.

   - (Defaults if the player dismisses: no display, no autorun, `roll_mode: players` — or the existing saved value — and everyone present.)
   - **Session tail replay:** before clearing the display, check if the campaign's `session_tail.json` exists. The campaign-side path is the authoritative one — `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/session_tail.json`. **Do NOT read** the legacy/fallback at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/session_tail.json`; that file may exist from older sessions or other campaigns and will mislead the replay. If the campaign-side file does not exist, skip replay (display starts blank). If it does, read it. After `--clear` and full stats push (step 4 below), replay the tail by sending each entry via the appropriate `send.py` flag. Entry type → flag mapping:
     - `player` key present → `send.py --player <name>` with text via stdin
     - `npc` key present → `send.py --npc <name>` with text via stdin
     - `dice` key present → `send.py --dice` with text via stdin
     - `xp_award` key present → `send.py --xp-award '<json of the xp_award sub-dict>'`
     - `inspiration_award` key present → `send.py --inspiration-award '<name>'`
     - `image` key present → `send.py --image '<file>' --image-kind <kind> --image-caption '<caption>' --image-subject '<subject>'` (the file already exists in `media/` — nothing is regenerated). Must run **after** `push_stats.py --set-campaign`, since the display serves media from the active campaign only.
     - none of the above (plain DM narration) → `send.py` with text via stdin
     This restores the last scene to the display before the recap. The tail is written continuously by `dnd-display-app.py` — it always contains the last session's final exchanges regardless of how the session ended.
   - Clear previous transcript: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --clear`

     ⚠ **`--clear` wipes both text log AND stats** (player card, world time, factions, quests). It must always be paired with the full `--replace-players ... --world-time ... --factions ... --quests ...` push from step 4 — otherwise the sidebar card and sheet tab render empty. Same rule applies any time you `--clear` mid-session (e.g. restoring scene state after a re-replay): always re-push the full character JSON + world-time + factions + quests in the same bash burst as the clear.
   - Register active campaign for DM Help: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --set-campaign <campaign-name>`
   - **LAN login check (LAN modes only).** In LAN mode every device except this PC must log in with its character's PIN — see *Display login PINs* below. Run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/accounts.py list --campaign <campaign-name>`. If a PC who is present (not in `absent:`) has no PIN, say so and offer to set it now (ask for that PC's PIN as its own question). Then tell the table: *"Open the display link, tap your character and enter your PIN."* When `start-display.sh` printed a `Players:` URL (public HTTPS certificate), that is the link to give. Never list or repeat a PIN.
   - If autorun **yes** → write `autorun: true` to `state.md → ## Session Flags`; enter the autorun wait after the recap paragraph.
   - If autorun **no** → continue without autorun; DM drives turns manually.
   - **Physical dice server check (only if installed).** Skip this step unless the optional dice server is set up: probe with `test -d ~/.dnd-dice || test "$DND_DICE_PHYSICAL" = "1"` and short-circuit out if the test fails. When it passes, run `curl -sf http://localhost:7777/health` (timeout 1s). If it returns OK, fetch the LAN IP with `python3 -c "import socket; s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM); s.connect(('8.8.8.8', 80)); print(s.getsockname()[0]); s.close()"` and announce to the table: *"Dice server is up. Each player, open `http://<ip>:7777/?player=<your-pc-name>` on your phone (lowercase name, hyphens for spaces — same name I'll use when calling for rolls) and tap **consecrate** before we begin. NPC and DM rolls auto-resolve here."* Then list the short-names of the PCs who are present (skip anyone in `absent:`) so players know what to type. If the server is unreachable, skip silently — `dice.py` falls back to local random.

2. **Backwards-compat: ruleset migration check.** Before reading state.md, run:

   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/migrate_ruleset.py <campaign-name> --check
   ```

   - Exit code `0` (`migrated`) → proceed to step 3.
   - Exit code `1` (`needs-migration`) → this is a legacy campaign predating the ruleset field. Surface to DM exactly once: *"Campaign predates ruleset versioning. Stamp as **2014** (recommended for legacy campaigns) or **2024**? state.md will be backed up to `state.md.backup-pre-ruleset-<timestamp>` before any write. [2014/2024/skip]"*. On answer, run:

     ```bash
     python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/migrate_ruleset.py <campaign-name> --ruleset 2014 --yes
     # or --ruleset 2024
     ```

     Migrator is idempotent and creates a timestamped backup. On `skip`, do not migrate; `paths.campaign_ruleset()` will return `2014` as the safety default at read time, but the field stays unstamped (DM will be re-prompted next load).
   - Exit code `2` (`missing`) → state.md not found; do not proceed with /dm:dnd load. Surface error to DM.

   Future migrations (e.g. when 2026 ruleset arrives) follow the same pattern: a small migrator script under `scripts/migrate_<topic>.py` invoked here as a `--check` then `--yes` pair.

3. **Read campaign ruleset** for this session: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/paths.py campaign-ruleset <name>` (or import `campaign_ruleset` directly). Stash the result; pass `--ruleset <value>` to `lookup.py`, `build_supplemental.py`, and `combat.py` mastery calls so they route to the correct dataset. The display companion picks up the same value automatically via `push_stats.py --set-campaign`.

4. Read SKILL-scripts.md (for script syntax this session)
5. **Mark this campaign active** (for the autosave hook): write `{"name": "<campaign-name>"}` to `$(python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/paths.py runtime-dir)/active-campaign.json`. This is what `autosave_checkpoint.py` reads to know which campaign to checkpoint; a stale marker is harmless. Then read state.md, world.md, npcs.md (index only), and all characters/*.md
   - **state.md contains `## DM Style Notes`** — read and internalize before narrating anything. These are table-specific calibration patterns that override default DM instincts.
   - **state.md contains `## Pinned Facts`** — read and keep hot for the whole session. These are stable soft facts the table has chosen never to forget (a promise made, a dead relative's name, a house rule, a running joke, a detail the player flagged as mattering). Unlike Live State Flags, they don't change turn-to-turn — they are standing canon. Weave them in when relevant and never contradict one; if a pinned fact is now wrong, correct it via `/dm:dnd pin` rather than silently overriding it. If the section reads *(none pinned yet)*, there's nothing to load.
   - **world.md:** Load in full — World Foundations, Three Truths, and factions inform narration and faction moves. Do NOT read `world-seeds.md` at load (generation artifact, not live reference).
   - **world-nodes.md (imported campaigns only):** Do **NOT** load at session start. It holds the full Quest Seed Bank and Adventure Nodes for the whole module; read only the current act's nodes on demand when a scene needs them. If the file is absent (dynamic/sandbox, or an older import), there is nothing to lazy-load — `world.md` already carries the nodes, unchanged from prior behavior.
   - **arc.md (imported campaigns only):** Do **NOT** load at session start. `state.md → ## Campaign Arc` already carries the current + next chapter window. Read `arc.md` only when advancing chapters or when a player asks about the broader arc. If absent, the arc lives inline in `state.md` (dynamic/sandbox) — read it there as before. **Sanity-check the pointer at load:** if `## Campaign Arc`'s `current_chapter` shows its `outstanding_beats` already cleared, or the last session plainly ended in the *next* chapter's location or situation, the pointer never advanced — surface it (*"the current chapter looks finished; pick up in `<next_chapter>`?"*) instead of opening another scene in a chapter that's already done. A pointer that never moves is exactly how a structured campaign quietly drifts off its own arc and starts improvising.
   - **source/<chapter-id>.md (imported campaigns only):** the full module text, one file per chapter. Never loaded at session start. Before running a scene in a chapter, read that chapter's `source/<id>.md` (the `source_ref` in the arc) — and only that chapter. This is the predefined-story equivalent of reading a single NPC's full entry on demand.
   - **npcs.md:** Index row only at load. **Before writing substantive dialogue or decisions for any named NPC, read their full entry in `npcs-full.md`.** Do not wait for an explicit `/dm:dnd npc [name]` call — do it proactively when a scene centers on that character. Index rows carry surface traits only; personality axes, relationships, and hidden goals are in the full entry.
   - **Do NOT read session-log.md at load** — recent events are already in `state.md → ## Recent Events`. Only read session-log.md if the player explicitly requests a recap, or if DM Calibration from the last 1-2 sessions is needed and not already internalized.
6. Push full party stats to display sidebar. **CRITICAL:** use `--json` with a complete player object — **never** the `--player` shorthand here. `--player` only updates existing fields; it cannot populate the card or sheet tabs. The display shows "Full sheet not loaded" when `sheet` is absent.

   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --replace-players --json '{
     "players": [
       {
         "name": "CharName",
         "race": "Race",
         "class": "Class (Background)",
         "level": N,
         "hp": {"current": N, "max": N, "temp": 0},
         "ac": N,
         "speed": 30,
         "hit_dice": {"max": N, "remaining": N, "die": "d8"},
         "xp": {"current": N, "next": N},
         "conditions": [],
         "concentration": null,
         "inspiration": 0,
         "spell_slots": {},
         "sheet": {
           "attacks": [{"name":"...","bonus":"+N","damage":"...","type":"...","notes":"..."}],
           "features": [{"name":"Feature 1","text":"Description of what it does."},{"name":"Feature 2","text":"Description."}],
           "inventory": ["Item 1", "Item 2"]
         }
       }
     ]
   }'
   ```

   For casters, add `"spells": {"cantrips":["..."],"level1":["..."]}` inside `sheet`. Omit for non-casters.

   **Inspiration:** read from `state.md → ## Current Situation → Party status`. Set `"inspiration": 1` (or `true`) if the character has it, `0` if not. Inspiration is NOT reset by a long rest — it persists until spent. Must be explicitly tracked in the party status line at `/dm:dnd save` (e.g., `Mara: Inspiration ✓`) and loaded at `/dm:dnd load`. Use `push_stats.py --player <name> --inspiration true/false` for mid-session updates.

   `--replace-players` clears stale characters from previous campaigns. Build the JSON from the character file — every field above is required for the card and sheet tabs to render correctly.

   **Present PCs only.** Leave out every PC named in `state.md → ## Session Flags → absent:` — the sidebar shows who is at the table tonight. Their sheets stay untouched on disk.

   Also push `--world-time`, `--factions`, and `--quests` in the **same** `push_stats.py` call as the player JSON to avoid race conditions where the display server receives a partial update. Combine all into one invocation:

   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --replace-players \
     --json '{...players...}' \
     --world-time '{...}' \
     --factions '[...]' \
     --quests '[...]'
   ```

   Faction JSON structure — **`standing` is required**:
   ```json
   [{"name":"Pale Court","standing":"Allied"},{"name":"The Kept","standing":"Hostile"}]
   ```
   `standing` values: `Allied`, `Friendly`, `Neutral`, `Suspicious`, `Hostile`. If the field is omitted, `dnd-display-app.py` defaults it to `"Neutral"` and logs a warning to stderr — but always include it explicitly. Map prose from `state.md` to exact values (e.g. "deep ally" → `"Allied"`, "active hostile" → `"Hostile"`). Use `[]` to clear.

   The faction panel only appears when at least one faction is present — do not skip this push.

   Quest JSON structure:
   ```json
   [{"name":"The Missing Shipment","status":"resolved"},{"name":"Keth the Collector","status":"threat"}]
   ```
   Quest `status` values: `active` (amber), `threat` (red), `resolved` (green), `failed` (muted). Use `[]` to clear all quests:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --quests '[...]'
   ```
   The quest panel only appears when at least one quest is present — do not skip this push.
7. **Pull scene-context from the campaign graph.** Always run, even if you suspect `graph.json` doesn't exist — the script exits cleanly with a notice when uninitialized.
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/campaign_graph.py scene-context \
     --campaign <campaign-name> \
     --place "<current-location-name-or-id>" \
     --present "<comma-separated-NPC-names-likely-present>" \
     --hops 2 \
     --at-session <current-session-N>
   ```
   Identify `<current-location>` from `state.md → ## World State → location` (or the most recent location in `## Recent Events`). Identify `<present>` from the NPCs likely on-scene per `state.md` / `session-log.md`. `<current-session-N>` is `state.md → ## Session Count`.

   Output is a focused subgraph (nodes by type + relationships block). **Internalize this subgraph before delivering the recap** — it is the authoritative source for who-relates-to-whom in the current scene. Do not re-read `npcs-full.md` for relationships you can answer from the subgraph.

   If output reads `# graph not initialized` — graph hasn't been seeded for this campaign yet. **Graph init is a hard requirement, not deferrable.** The continuity-archive compression rule (step 6 below + `/dm:dnd save`) assumes graph.json is present and canonical for relational state; deferring init creates state-archive drift that compounds session-over-session. Run the init flow before delivering the recap:

   1. **Detect legacy.** A campaign is "legacy" if any of: `Session count > 1` in state.md header, OR `## Continuity Archive` has at least one `### Session N` entry, OR session-log.md is > 100 lines. A freshly-created campaign at `/dm:dnd new` time fails all three signals — do NOT classify it as legacy.

   2. **Backup the campaign directory** (always — both fresh and legacy):
      ```bash
      cp -R ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name> \
            ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
      ```
      Tell the DM the backup path explicitly so they can revert if needed.

   3. **Run `/dm:dnd graph init <name>`** — propose seed nodes/edges from `npcs.md`, `world.md`, and `state.md` (Live State Flags + Active Quests + recent NPC dispositions). Show the DM a single approval block (counts by type + named entries) and ask for one go/no-go. After approval, batch-execute the `add-node` and `add-edge` calls. Use `--since N` matching when each node/edge first became canon (use `1` for foundational; the actual session number for newer NPCs/edges).

   4. **Validate** with a `scene-context` query at the current location to confirm the subgraph is reachable.

   5. **(Legacy only)** Offer the one-time Continuity Archive compression pass:

      > "This campaign is legacy ({session_count} sessions, {archive_count} archive entries). Now that `graph.json` is the canonical source for faction memberships, NPC dispositions, and typed-edge relationships, I can do a one-time pass to trim the existing `## Continuity Archive` entries of relational restatements that the graph now answers. Mechanical changes, plot beats, atmospheric/decision moments, and disclosed information stay in full. Estimated reduction: 5–30% of archive bytes (varies by how relational vs. content-heavy your existing entries are). Backup is already at `<backup-path>`. Proceed? [y/n]"

      - `y` → trim each archive entry surgically; keep the bullet structure; remove ONLY pure-relational restatements (e.g. "X is allied with Y", "Z saw the party's faces", "W is a member of faction F") that have a corresponding edge in the just-initialized graph. Preserve: XP/level/items/HP, plot beats ("Beat 2a sealed"), atmospheric moments, disclosed content, calibration material, off-screen world events. Add a one-line note at the top of `## Continuity Archive`: *"Compressed YYYY-MM-DD (graph init pass). Relational state is canonical in graph.json — entries below preserve mechanical changes, plot beats, disclosed content, atmospheric/decision moments, and calibration material."*
      - `n` → leave the archive untouched. The going-forward compression rule (per `/dm:dnd save`) still applies to NEW entries from this session forward.

      For fresh (non-legacy) campaigns: skip the offer entirely — there's nothing to compress yet, and the going-forward rule covers all future entries.

   6. Re-run scene-context (now populated). Then proceed to step 6 (recap).

8. Deliver one in-character paragraph recapping current situation — where the party is, what's at stake, what was last happening. **Attendance:** if `absent:` names anyone, give each benched PC one in-fiction line explaining why they're not in the scene (see SKILL.md → *Absent players*). If a PC who was absent last session (`## Recent Events → Absent: …`) is back, write them back in with one line, and give their player a two-sentence out-of-character catch-up on what they missed.
9. Enter active DM mode — no `/dm:dnd` prefix needed from this point.

## `/dm:dnd import <filepath> [campaign-name]`

Import a pre-written campaign from a source file (PDF, MD, TXT, DOCX) and create a playable campaign from it.

**Supported file types:** `.pdf` `.md` `.txt` `.markdown` `.docx`

### Step 1 — Extract source text
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/import_campaign.py "<filepath>" --info
```
**PDF sources:** extraction uses PyMuPDF (column-aware) so multi-column modules de-column into reading order and segment into chapters correctly — without it, two-column books collapse into one chapter. If the script prints a `pip3 install pymupdf` notice on its stderr, tell the DM to install it and re-run; it falls back to `pdftotext` otherwise but segmentation is less reliable.

Print file info. If word count is over 4000, chunk the source:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/import_campaign.py "<filepath>" --chunks  # total chunks
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/import_campaign.py "<filepath>" --chunk 0  # first chunk
```
For short sources (under 4000 words), read in full:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/import_campaign.py "<filepath>"
```

### Step 2 — Analyse structure
Read the extracted text and identify:
- **Campaign title and system**
- **Structure type:** `linear` (scene chain A→B→C) | `hub-and-spoke` (central hub + spoke locations, player-driven order) | `faction-web` (multi-faction city/complex, overlapping arcs)
- **Acts and chapters** — numbered sections, chapter headings, or named scenes
- **Key beats** — required story events the DM must deliver (boss reveals, faction turns, mandatory encounters)
- **Locations** — distinct named places with descriptions
- **NPCs** — names, roles, motivations, relationships, stat blocks if present
- **Factions** — groups with agendas, relationships to party
- **Quest hooks and seeds** — explicit adventure hooks, side quests, optional encounters
- **Starting conditions** — where does the party begin, what level, what's the inciting event

For large sources, read all chunks before proceeding.

### Step 3 — Confirm campaign name
If `[campaign-name]` not supplied, suggest one from the title and ask to confirm.

### Step 4 — Display summary and confirm
Show a structured summary before writing any files:

```
Title:    <source title>
Type:     structured / <structure type>
Acts:     N  |  Chapters: N  |  Key beats: N
NPCs:     N named  |  Factions: N
Locations: N distinct

Campaign name: <name>
Campaign dir:  ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/

Proceed? [y/n]
```

### Step 5 — Create campaign files
On confirmation:

1. `mkdir -p ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/characters`
2. Copy templates from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/`
3. Write **world.md** (load-time core — kept small so it can be read in full every load):
   - `## World Foundations` — setting, geography, tone, magic level, calendar if present
   - `## Three Truths` — one settlement, one threat, one mystery (drawn from source)
   - `## Threat Escalation Arc` — map source acts to the 5-stage table; set stage 1
   - `## Factions` — all factions with archetype, current activity, relationship to party

3a. Write **world-nodes.md** (lazy reference — NOT read at load, pulled per current act):
   - `## Quest Seed Bank` — all explicit hooks + 2–3 implied side threads
   - `## Adventure Nodes` — named locations with one-line descriptions, grouped by act/chapter

   For a small module the split is optional, but for any published adventure it is the
   single biggest load-time saving — the whole quest/location bank no longer sits in
   context every session. If you write `world-nodes.md`, do **not** duplicate its
   sections into `world.md`.

4. Write **npcs.md** index table (one row per NPC: name, role, location, one-line demeanor)

5. Write **npcs-full.md** — full entry for each named NPC:
   - Role, motivation, secret, speech quirk, faction affiliation
   - Relationships to other NPCs (min 2 per NPC)
   - Stat block summary if present in source

6. Write **arc.md** from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/arc.md` — the **full** act/chapter tree: every chapter's `id`, `title`, `location`, `source_ref` (its file in the lazy corpus, see step 6b), `key_beats`, `telegraph_scene`, `branching_notes`, plus `outstanding_beats` and `steering_notes`. This is the heavy structure; it lives here so it is read on demand, not at every load.

6a. Write **state.md** from template:
   - Populate `## Current Situation` — starting location and party placeholder
   - Populate `## World State` — in-world date if given, factions, threat arc stage 1
   - Populate `## Campaign Arc` with the **STRUCTURED ARC POINTER only** (see template): `type: structured`, `source`, `structure`, `arc_file: arc.md`, `current_act`, `current_chapter`, the `current_chapter_detail` block, `next_chapter`, `outstanding_beats`, `steering_notes`. **Delete the entire DYNAMIC ARC yaml block** from the template — do not leave both arc forms in the file. The full tree is in arc.md; state.md carries only the current + next chapter window.
   - Leave `## Active Quests`, `## Session Flags` (autosave defaults on), `## DM Style Notes` as template defaults

6b. Write the **lazy corpus** — the full source text, kept available but out of the hot path:
   - `mkdir -p ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/source`
   - For each chapter in arc.md, write `source/<chapter-id>.md` (e.g. `source/1.1.md`) containing that chapter's source text from the extracted chunks. Use the same chapter ids as arc.md.
   - Write `source-index.md` — a table mapping `chapter-id → source/<id>.md → one-line scope`, plus source title and import date.
   - Validate the layout: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/corpus_check.py --campaign <name>` (expects "lazy-corpus layout OK"). Fix any orphan/missing-file problems before finishing. If it prints an **oversized-chapter WARNING**, split that chapter into sub-chapters (e.g. `1.1a` / `1.1b` at natural scene breaks) across `arc.md`, `source-index.md`, and `source/`, then re-run — a single giant chapter is the one thing that still bloats a load, so keep each `source/<id>.md` comfortably under the limit.

7. Write **session-log.md** with Session 0 import record:
   ```
   ## Session 0 — Import — <date>
   Source: <filepath>
   Imported: <N> acts, <N> chapters, <N> NPCs, <N> locations
   ```

### Step 6 — Gap-fill wizard
After writing files, identify anything the source left ambiguous:
- If starting level not specified → ask
- If party size not specified → ask
- If calendar/in-world date absent → offer to generate or leave blank
- If tone not clear from source → offer Tone/Genre Wizard

### Step 7 — Confirm and offer next step
Print summary of files written. Offer:
```
Campaign "<name>" created from <source title>.
→ /dm:dnd character new      — create your character
→ /dm:dnd load <name>        — start playing immediately
```

---

## `/dm:dnd save`
Write session events to session-log.md, update state.md (location, active quests, party HP/resources, recent events), update any characters/*.md that changed. Mirror each updated character to global roster (`~/.claude/dnd/characters/<name>.md`).

**Absent players:** if `## Session Flags → absent:` names anyone, open this session's session-log entry with `Absent: <names> — <one-line in-fiction reason>` and add the same line to `## Recent Events`, so the next load can write them back in. Absent PCs' sheets change only by the XP they were awarded — never touch their HP, slots, inventory or conditions.

**Inspiration tracking:** On every save, record each PC's Inspiration state in `state.md → ## Current Situation → Party status`. Use explicit text: `Inspiration ✓` if held, omit or `No Inspiration` if not. Inspiration persists across sessions and is NOT cleared by long rests. Example: `Mara: HP 24/24. Inspiration ✓. Theo: HP 24/24.`

**Update `## Live State Flags` in state.md on every save.** This section is the compaction-resistant anchor — it holds facts that prose summaries flatten. After each session, review and update:
- **Cover:** each PC's active cover, its status (INTACT / BLOWN / PARTIAL), and the one-line reason. Remove covers that are no longer active.
- **Faction stances:** each faction with non-neutral standing toward the party. Format: `[Faction]: [Allied/Friendly/Neutral/Suspicious/Hostile] — [one-line reason]`. Remove factions that have returned to neutral.
- **NPC dispositions:** each NPC with changed or notable standing. Format: `[Name]: [disposition] — [one-line reason]`. Remove NPCs who have returned to baseline.

If nothing changed in a category this session, leave it as-is. If a fact was wrong in the previous save, correct it.

**Structured (imported) campaigns — keep the arc window and arc.md in sync.** Advancing the pointer is not optional bookkeeping — it is what keeps the campaign on its own rails, and a pointer that never moves is how an imported module quietly becomes an improvised one. Before you decide "no chapter advanced," check honestly: **if this session cleared the last of the current chapter's `outstanding_beats`, or the party has plainly moved into the next chapter's location or situation, the chapter advanced — treat it as such and move the pointer now.** When a chapter advances: mark the completed chapter `status: complete` in `arc.md`, set the new chapter `status: current`, and update `state.md → ## Campaign Arc` so its `current_chapter`, `current_chapter_detail`, `next_chapter`, and `outstanding_beats` reflect the new window. The full tree stays in `arc.md`; `state.md` carries only the current + next chapter so the load stays light. Only when the party is genuinely still mid-chapter, update `outstanding_beats`/`steering_notes` inline in `state.md` — no need to touch `arc.md`. (Dynamic/sandbox campaigns have no `arc.md`; update the inline arc in `state.md` as before.)

Then update `## Faction Moves` in state.md: for each active faction, answer *"what did they do while the party was occupied?"* One line per faction — even if nothing visible yet. Confirm what was written.

**Session tail archive:** `dnd-display-app.py` continuously writes `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/session_tail.json` — campaign-specific path, atomic-write, skip-on-empty guarded (since 2026-05-01). At save time:

1. Verify the campaign-side file exists and is non-empty:
   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/verify_tail.sh <campaign-name>
   ```
   The script returns 0 if the tail is healthy (non-empty + valid JSON list), 1 if missing/empty/corrupt. If it returns 1, the tail is unsafe to rely on for next session's replay — **write a canonical replacement directly to the campaign path** with this session's 5–8 most important narrative beats as a JSON list of `{"text": "...", "_camp": "<name>"}` entries (no display call needed; the display may already be dead). Use the `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/write_canonical_tail.py` helper.
2. Also write `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/session-tail.md` (human-readable snapshot — companion to the JSON, used as fallback during /dm:dnd load if JSON read fails).

**Session log archival (run on every save after session count > 3):**
session-log.md keeps only the **2 most recent full session entries**. Older entries move to `session-log-archive.md` (append, never delete). Before archiving each entry, extract a 3–5 bullet continuity summary and write it to `## Continuity Archive` in state.md. Format:

```markdown
### Session N — [date] — [one-line location/event label]
- [Key fact that may resurface as a callback]
- [NPC revelation, exact wording of something important, decision that has consequences]
- [Roll outcome that changed the fiction]
- [Item acquired with story significance, plot beat, atmospheric/decision moment]
```

**Going-forward Continuity Archive compression rule (from 2026-05-07; applies when `graph.json` exists for the campaign):** When `graph.json` is present, the Continuity Archive bullets must NOT restate relational state that the graph holds canonically. Specifically, **omit** bullets/clauses that say:
- "X is allied with Y" / "X is hostile to Y" / "X is friendly with Y" — already a typed edge with `--since N` and source-anchor
- "X is a member of faction F" / "X works for Y" / "X reports to Y" — already a `member_of` / `works_for` / `reports_on` edge
- "Z saw the party's faces" / "K is now in the Kept profile" — already a `hostile_to` / `surveils` edge with `--since`
- Faction memberships and NPC dispositions that haven't changed this session
- Restated NPC profiles (job title, age, location) that already live as node tags + summary

**Keep** in archive bullets:
- Mechanical changes (XP awarded, level-ups, items gained/spent, slots burned, HP deltas at session end)
- Plot beats (arc beat completions, "Beat 2a sealed", "Beat 2b LANDED")
- Atmospheric / decision moments that have no graph edge ("Mira ate the bread — first food in 800 years", "Mara squeezed her hand")
- Disclosed content (the WHAT was learned — "fragment / anchor / host", "three acceleration factors") even when the relational fact is in graph
- Off-screen world events / faction moves
- Calibration / DM Notes
- Cliffhangers and pause-points

Treat each bullet as one sentence with one job. If the only job is "restate a graph edge", drop it. If it carries content + edge, keep the content half. The graph is queried at `/dm:dnd load` step 5; the archive is queried for chronological narrative + mechanical state — they should not overlap.

The continuity summary is what stays hot in context. The full verbose log is in the archive, readable on `/dm:dnd recap` or explicit request. When a past detail surfaces mid-scene, check `## Continuity Archive` first, then `/dm:dnd graph scene-context` for relational context, then read session-log-archive.md if more depth is needed.

**Campaign-graph relationship-shift sweep:** before completing the save, scan this session's narration for relationship shifts that weren't captured live via `/dm:dnd graph add-edge` / `close-edge`. Look for moments matching these patterns:

- New alliance, betrayal, or rivalry between named NPCs / factions ("Velkyn now serves the Pale Court")
- A shift in how the **party** stands toward an NPC or faction ("the Pale Court now reads the party as hostile", "Aldric came around and trusts them"). Draft these as `set-disposition --to <npc-or-faction> --level <allied/friendly/neutral/suspicious/hostile>` calls, matching the `standing` you push to the display and the NPC-disposition lines in `## Live State Flags`.
- An NPC moving into / out of a location ("Mira fled the Citadel for the Lowmarket")
- A faction taking control of (or losing) a place ("House Tarn lost the silver mine")
- A character learning a secret ("the party now knows Velkyn was the spy")
- A quest / thread ending or being blocked

For each candidate, draft an `add-edge` or `close-edge` call. Then **present the batch to the DM as a numbered list** and ask: *"Apply all? [y / pick / skip]"*

- `y` → run all proposed calls via `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/campaign_graph.py ...`
- `pick` → DM names the numbers to apply (e.g. `1, 3, 5`); skip the rest
- `skip` → don't apply any

Always supply `--since <current-session-N>` from state.md. Never write proposed edges silently.

If `graph.json` doesn't exist yet for this campaign, skip the sweep entirely (no proposal block) — graph isn't seeded.

---

## `/dm:dnd end`
1. Run `/dm:dnd save`, then:
   a. Append **Session Recap** block to session-log.md with key events and open threads.
   b. Ask: *"Quick calibration — what worked this session, and what would you adjust next time?"* Write answers to `### DM Calibration`. If skipped, leave blank.
   c. Update `## World State` in state.md: check whether events advanced the threat arc stage, shifted faction states, or changed the in-world date. Update all three.
   d. If the calibration response reveals a new pattern (or confirms/contradicts an existing one), update `## DM Style Notes` in state.md. Add new bullets; refine existing ones if the pattern has sharpened. Do not log every session — only update when something genuinely new or changed is observed.
   e. **Arc check** (dynamic arcs only — skip for sandbox/structured): If `## Campaign Arc` has `type: dynamic`, do all of:

      i. Ask: *"Did any arc beats land this session? [beat id(s) like '1b 2a', or 'none']"*
      ii. If beats landed: run `/dm:dnd arc advance <beat-id>` for each.
      iii. **Pre-emption check (critical — added 2026-05-01):** for each remaining outstanding beat whose `world_pressure` was visibly delivered this session (the world event named in the beat actually appeared in narration or Faction Moves), evaluate whether the beat's `what_changes` consequence ALSO landed. Three possible states:
        - **Landed cleanly** → mark beat complete (step ii).
        - **Did not land — pressure absorbed without consequence** → the beat is overdue and its current shape no longer fits. **Run `/dm:dnd arc revise` immediately**; do not just update `steering_notes`. The beat's `what_changes` was event-shaped (something specific happens) when it should be consequence-shaped (something fundamentally different is true) — revise both `what_changes` and `world_pressure` to fit a path that DOES land. The committed shape bends; it does not break.
        - **Pressure not yet delivered** → leave beat alone; expected to deliver next session.
      iv. Update `steering_notes` for the next outstanding beat with the *consequence shape* expected, not the specific event.
   f. **Tail verification (added 2026-05-01):** before killing the display, verify the campaign-side `session_tail.json` is healthy:
      ```bash
      bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/verify_tail.sh <campaign-name>
      ```
      Exit 0 = healthy. Exit 1 = missing/empty/corrupt → write a canonical replacement to `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/session_tail.json` from session context (5–8 entries, each `{"text": "...", "_camp": "<name>"}`) BEFORE the display kill — once the display is dead, only the file matters. The display's own `_persist_tail` has skip-on-empty + atomic-write guards, but the backstop ensures a worst-case file state is impossible.
2. Stop the display (always — even if `_display_running` was unclear):
   ```bash
   kill $(cat ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/app.pid 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null
   rm -f ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/app.pid
   ```
3. **Post-kill tail re-verification:** run `verify_tail.sh` once more after the kill. If it now reports unhealthy (file got truncated by a final write race), restore from the canonical version written in step 1f.

---

## `/dm:dnd abandon`

Exit the current session **without saving any state changes**. Use this when an error occurred and you want to discard everything since the last `/dm:dnd save` (or since load, if the session was never saved).

1. Confirm: *"Abandon session? All unsaved state changes will be lost. Type 'yes' to confirm."* — do not proceed until confirmed.
2. Do **NOT** write to state.md, world.md, npcs.md, session-log.md, or any character files.
3. Clear the autorun flag in memory (`autorun: false`) so the wait loop does not restart.
4. If `_display_running = true`, stop the display:
   ```bash
   kill $(cat ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/app.pid 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null
   rm -f ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/app.pid
   ```
5. Confirm: *"Session abandoned. No files were written. Run `/dm:dnd load <campaign>` to reload from the last saved state."*

---

## `/dm:dnd data [sync|status]`
- `sync` → `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sync_srd.py` — checks upstream SHAs (5e-bits + FoundryVTT) and rebuilds `dnd5e_srd.json` only if either source has new commits
- `sync --force` → `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/sync_srd.py --force` — rebuild regardless
- `sync --check` → check upstream without rebuilding
- `status` → `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_srd.py --status` — show current dataset metadata

Dataset is bundled at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/data/dnd5e_srd.json` (1453 records: spells, equipment, magic items, conditions, monsters, class features). No download required at runtime. Run `sync` only when you want to pull new upstream content.

---

## `/dm:dnd path [<new-path> | reset]`

View or configure where campaign and character data is stored. Wraps the
`DND_CAMPAIGN_ROOT` env var.

- No args → `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/path_config.py` and show output.
- New path → `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/path_config.py set <path>`. Confirm to user, then remind them the change only takes effect in new shells (or after they `source` their rc on macOS/Linux).
- `reset` → `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/path_config.py reset`.

Persistence is via shell rc on macOS/Linux and via `setx` on Windows. Existing campaigns are not auto-migrated; `paths.find_campaign()` handles legacy fallback + copy-on-access.

---

## `/dm:dnd update [--check]`

Pull the latest skill changes from `origin/main`.

- No args → `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/update_skill.py` and stream output (script prompts before pulling).
- `--check` → `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/update_skill.py --check` — report status without pulling.
- The script refuses to update if the working tree is dirty and uses `--ff-only` so it never silently merges divergent history.
- After a successful pull, remind the user to restart Claude Code so the new `SKILL.md` and `SKILL-commands.md` are reloaded.

---

## `/dm:dnd display [start|stop|status]`
- `start` → ask LAN mode [y/n]; run `bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/start-display.sh [--lan]`; print URL(s)
- `stop` → `kill $(cat ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/app.pid) 2>/dev/null && rm -f ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/app.pid`
- `status` → `curl -sk $(cat ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/.scheme 2>/dev/null || echo http)://localhost:5001/ping` — reachable or unreachable
- No argument → print quick-start instructions

### Display login PINs

In LAN mode (`--lan`) the display shows a login screen to every device except this PC: the player taps their character and types its PIN, and from then on that phone acts **only** as that character — actions, rolls, its own sheet. Players can't reach DM controls. This PC (localhost) is always the DM and needs no PIN. Local mode (no `--lan`) has no login.

PINs are stored only as salted hashes — in `<campaign>/accounts.json` for characters, in the runtime dir for the DM PIN.

| Request | Command |
|---|---|
| Set or reset a character's PIN | `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/accounts.py set-pin --campaign <c> --character "<Name>" --pin <digits>` |
| Remove a character's login | `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/accounts.py remove --campaign <c> --character "<Name>"` |
| Who has a PIN | `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/accounts.py list --campaign <c>` |
| Log every player out | `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/accounts.py logout-all --campaign <c>` |
| DM PIN (to run the main display from a TV or tablet) | `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/accounts.py set-dm-pin --pin <digits>` / `remove-dm-pin` |

Rules:
- A PIN is 4–8 digits. Setting a new PIN logs out whoever was logged in as that character.
- **Never** write a PIN into a character sheet, `state.md`, the session log, or the display, and never repeat it back. Confirm only "PIN set for [Name]".
- Wrong PINs are throttled (5 per device per 15 min, 10 per character per hour). If a player is locked out, they wait, or the DM resets the PIN.
- Sessions last 30 days, and end on a PIN change, on `logout-all`, or when another campaign is loaded. Players can also log out from the phone ⚙ menu.

## `/dm:dnd list`
Read `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/*/state.md`, print summary table: campaign name | last session date | session count.

---

## `/dm:dnd character new [campaign-name]`

**Read the campaign's ruleset first** — `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/paths.py` is not a CLI; instead inline-read with:

```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts'); from paths import campaign_ruleset; print(campaign_ruleset('<campaign>'))"
```

The result drives branching at steps 1 (ASI source), 4 (origin feat), and 5 (subclass timing). The default `2014` applies for legacy campaigns predating the ruleset field.

**First, offer the two build paths — call `AskUserQuestion`:** *"How do you want to build [or: your character]?"*
- `Step by step` → the guided flow below (steps 1–10). Use this when the player wants to make each choice deliberately, or already knows the exact build.
- `Describe it` → the prose path (step 0 below). Use this when the player would rather say who the character is in a sentence and let you assemble a legal sheet.

Default to `Step by step` if the question is dismissed. Either path lands in the same sheet and runs the same validation, calc, and write steps — the only difference is how the choices are gathered.

0. **Describe-it path.** Ask one open question: *"In a sentence or two, describe your character — who they are, how they fight or solve problems, where they come from. I'll build a legal, level-appropriate 5e sheet from it and show you before anything's written."* Then:

   a. **Derive the build from the prose, model-side.** Map the description to a legal 5e chassis for this campaign's ruleset: **class** (and, if the level warrants it, subclass per the ruleset's timing — see step 5), **species/race**, **background**, ability-score priorities (which two or three scores the concept leans on), skill/tool proficiencies the class+background grant, a fighting style or starting spells if the class has them, and a one-line **Character Pillar** (Bond / Flaw / Ideal / Goal — the same field step 2 fills). Read the description for what the player actually cares about — a "disgraced temple guard who talks their way out of fights" is a Paladin or Cleric with a Soldier/Acolyte background and CHA/CON priority, not a generic pick. Never invent a detail the prose contradicts; where the prose is silent, choose the most concept-fitting legal option and note it as a choice, not a fact.

   b. **Validate against 5e legality before showing anything.** The derived sheet must be legal for the campaign's ruleset and the agreed starting level: class/species/background all exist in 5e (SRD or a source the table allows — look up anything you're unsure of via `lookup.py`), ability scores come from a legal method (roll or point buy — step 3), ASI source matches the ruleset (race in 2014, background + one origin feat in 2024 — step 1), proficiencies are actually granted by the chosen class+background (no double-dipping, no out-of-list picks), and any spells/features are available at this level. If the concept implies something illegal (a level-1 character with a capstone feature, a subclass earlier than the ruleset grants it), pick the closest legal equivalent and say so.

   c. **Present the derived sheet for one confirmation.** Show the full build — species/race, class (+ subclass if any), background, ability array with the concept's priorities assigned, proficiencies, starting kit, and the derived Pillar with its source sentence — and ask: *"This is what I read from your description. Change anything, or shall I roll it up?"* Let the player adjust any field in prose; re-validate after any change.

   d. **Converge into the shared flow.** On confirmation, run the name-uniqueness check (step 1's `name_registry.py check`), then continue at **step 3** (finalize ability scores — reuse the derived priorities), **step 4** (racial/background bonuses + `character.py calc`), and steps 6–10 (equipment, write, roster mirror, supplemental builder). Do not re-ask the step-by-step questions the description already answered; only fill genuine gaps.

1. Ask: name, **species** (2024) or **race** (2014), class, background.

   **Name uniqueness check:** run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/name_registry.py check "<name>"`. Exit 1 (duplicate) → surface prior use; player confirms or changes. Record after step 9.

   **2014 (race-as-ASI):** the species/race grants ability score increases (e.g. Wood Elf: +2 DEX, +1 WIS). Apply to abilities at step 4.
   **2024 (background-as-ASI):** the **background** grants the +2/+1 ability score increase OR three +1s, AND a free **Origin Feat** (e.g. Magic Initiate, Lucky, Tough). Species grants traits but no ability scores. Players in 2024 must pick background BEFORE rolling abilities — the background's ASI pattern dictates which scores benefit.
2. Ask: *"In a sentence, what should the DM know about [Name]?"*
   - If answered: derive ONE pillar — **Bond**, **Flaw**, **Ideal**, or **Goal** (whichever fits best). Store both the raw sentence and derived pillar in `## Character Pillar`.
   - If skipped: leave `## Character Pillar` blank. Do not invent one. Do not re-prompt.
3. Ask: roll or point buy
   - Roll → `ability-scores.py roll`, present 3 arrays, player assigns
   - Point buy → `ability-scores.py pointbuy --check <scores>` to validate
4. Apply racial bonuses. Run `character.py calc` to derive all secondary stats.
5. Ask: Fighting Style (Fighter/Paladin/Ranger), spells (if caster)
6. Assign starting equipment per class + background
7. Write to `characters/<name>.md` using `templates/character-sheet.md`; set `## Campaign History → Origin campaign`. Fill `**Image look:**` with a short English description (≤ 15 words: species, build, hair/beard, armour, signature weapon) derived from the build and anything the player said about their appearance — every image of this character starts from it.
8. Add to `state.md` party line
9. Mirror to global roster: `cp characters/<name>.md ~/.claude/dnd/characters/<name>.md`
10. Run supplemental builder to fetch any non-SRD spells/features the character uses:
    ```bash
    python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_supplemental.py --character ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/characters/<charname>.md
    ```
    This scans the character file for spells and features not in the SRD and fetches descriptions from dnd5e.wikidot.com into `dnd5e_supplemental.json`. Skips any entries already present. Safe to re-run.
11. **Display login PIN.** Ask, as its own question: *"Choose a numeric PIN for [Name] (4–8 digits; 6 is safer). The player types it on their phone to log in to the display as [Name] — nobody else can play them. Say 'later' to skip."* Then set it — see *Display login PINs* below. A skipped PIN means [Name] can't log in from another device until one is set.

---

## `/dm:dnd character sheet [name]`
Read `characters/<name>.md`, display cleanly. If name omitted and one character exists, show that one.

---

## `/dm:dnd character import <name> [from:<campaign>]`
1. Find character sheet: `from:<campaign>` specified → that campaign's characters/; otherwise check global roster `~/.claude/dnd/characters/<name>.md`; if neither → search all campaigns, list matches, ask.
2. Show summary (level, XP, HP, key inventory) and ask: *"Import at current level [X], or level up before starting?"*
   - As-is → copy directly; Level up first → run `/dm:dnd level up` on source sheet
3. Copy to current campaign's `characters/<name>.md`. Update: Campaign, Last Updated, Previous campaigns, Death Saves (reset).
4. Optionally ask about equipment adjustment for new setting.
5. Add to `state.md` party line. Update global roster.
6. Run supplemental builder for any non-SRD entries:
    ```bash
    python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_supplemental.py --character ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/characters/<charname>.md
    ```
7. PINs are per campaign. **Web-created character** (the sheet has a `**Status:**` line): first run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/accounts.py import-web-pin --campaign <campaign> --character "<Name>"` — it copies the PIN the player chose on the web, so don't ask for one. Then delete the `**Status:**` line from both the campaign copy and the roster sheet, and fill `**Player:**`/`**Campaign:**`/`Origin campaign` as usual. If the import was the DM's decision to change the level, do the level-up at step 2 as for any import. Otherwise (no web PIN), ask for this character's display login PIN in the new campaign (same question as `character new` step 11) and set it.
8. Deliver one-paragraph in-character aside — how does it feel to step into a new world?

---

## `/dm:dnd level up [name]`
1. **XP gate — check first:**

   | Level | XP required | Level | XP required |
   |-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
   | 2 | 300 | 11 | 85,000 |
   | 3 | 900 | 12 | 100,000 |
   | 4 | 2,700 | 13 | 120,000 |
   | 5 | 6,500 | 14 | 140,000 |
   | 6 | 14,000 | 15 | 165,000 |
   | 7 | 23,000 | 16 | 195,000 |
   | 8 | 34,000 | 17 | 225,000 |
   | 9 | 48,000 | 18 | 265,000 |
   | 10 | 64,000 | 19 | 305,000 |
   |    |         | 20 | 355,000 |

   Insufficient XP → report deficit and stop. Only continue on explicit DM override.
2. Read sheet. Run `character.py levelup`. Apply class features. Ask for HP roll or average. Update sheet + global roster. Narrate the growth.

   **Ruleset-aware subclass timing (added 2026-05-08):** read campaign ruleset via `paths.campaign_ruleset(<campaign>)`.
   - **2014:** Subclass selection happens at the class's specified level (Cleric/Sorcerer/Warlock at 1; Druid/Wizard at 2; most others at 3).
   - **2024:** Subclass selection unifies at **level 3** for ALL classes. If the player is hitting level 3 in a 2024 campaign and hasn't picked a subclass yet, prompt for it. Class features that 2014 placed at level 1 (e.g. Cleric Domain) shift to level 3 in 2024.

   **Weapon Mastery (2024 only):** Fighter/Barbarian/Paladin/Ranger gain Weapon Mastery at level 1 (Fighter knows 3 mastery properties; others know 2). Track which properties the character knows on the sheet under `## Class Features → Weapon Mastery: <list>`. Properties are picked from the eight in `data/dnd5e_srd_2024.json → weapon_mastery_properties`. The character can use mastery only with weapons that have the matching property (look up on `data/dnd5e_srd_2024.json → equipment[…].mastery`).

---

## `/dm:dnd npc [name]`
- Existing → read full entry from npcs-full.md (search by name), portray in character with voice/quirk
- New → generate full entry: role, CR-appropriate stats, demeanor, motivation, secret, speech quirk, faction (or "independent"), current goal, schedule, all four personality axes, ≥2 relationships to existing NPCs. Default attitude neutral. Append full entry to npcs-full.md; add one-line summary row to npcs.md index.

  **Name uniqueness check (added 2026-05-07):** before generating, run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/name_registry.py check "<proposed-name>"`. If duplicate (exit 1), surface the prior use to the DM and offer either: (a) proceed with the duplicate (some scenarios want recurring names — a Voss reference can be deliberate); or (b) regenerate with a different name. Whichever path is chosen, after the NPC is added to npcs.md / npcs-full.md, call `name_registry.py add --name "<name>" --type npc --campaign <name> --session <current>` to record the entry.

  When **/dm:dnd new** generates a batch of NPCs during world-gen, run the check on each generated name in the same loop: if duplicate, regenerate that name (re-prompt the LLM with the prior name added to a "do-not-pick" exclusion list). After world-gen completes, batch-call `name_registry.py add` for every accepted NPC.

## `/dm:dnd npc attitude <name> <shift>`
Find NPC in npcs.md, shift attitude one step (hostile → unfriendly → neutral → friendly → allied), log reason and date.

## `/dm:dnd npc rename "Old Name" <"New Name" | random> [flags]`
Rename a character across an entire campaign — `npcs.md`, `npcs-full.md`, `state.md` (every section), `session-log.md`, `graph.json` (node + edges preserved), and `characters/<slug>.md` if `--type pc`. Backs up the campaign first.

Maps to: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/npc_rename.py --campaign <current> --old "..." --new "..." [flags]`. Use the currently loaded campaign by default; for explicit-campaign use, pass `--campaign <name>` directly.

Flags:
- `--random` — pick a name from the bundled fantasy-name corpus (~4800 unique combinations) that isn't already in `~/.claude/dnd/.name_registry.json`. Mutually exclusive with explicit "New Name".
- `--type npc | pc` (default `npc`) — `pc` also moves the character file and updates the global roster.
- `--dry-run` — show all hits across files without writing. Always run first for sanity.
- `--yes` — skip the confirmation prompt.
- `--include-archive` — also rename in `session-log-archive.md`. **Default is to leave the archive untouched** for historical accuracy and add a one-line audit note at the top: *"`<old>` renamed to `<new>` at S<N>; historical entries below preserve the original name."*

The script always backs up the campaign to `<name>.backup-rename-<old-slug>-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/` before any writes. Revert command is printed at the end.

After rename, the name registry is updated: old name marked `retired_from` this campaign with `replaced_by` pointing at the new slug; new name added with this campaign's current session as `first_session`.

## `/dm:dnd registry <subcommand>`
View and manage the cross-campaign name registry at `~/.claude/dnd/.name_registry.json`. Used by `/dm:dnd npc rename --random` to never reuse a name and (in a follow-up) by `/dm:dnd new` / `/dm:dnd character new` / `/dm:dnd npc <new>` to flag duplicates at creation time.

Maps to: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/name_registry.py <subcommand> [args]`.

- `/dm:dnd registry rebuild [--include-prose]` — scan every campaign's `npcs.md`, `npcs-full.md`, `characters/*.md`, and `graph.json` (node names); rebuild the registry from canonical sources. Preserves any existing `retired_from` history. Run once on install, then ad hoc when desired.

  **`--include-prose` (added 2026-05-07, opt-in):** also scan `session-log.md` and `session-log-archive.md` for capitalized 2–3-word sequences (likely-name patterns). Filtered against a stopword list (places, factions, mechanic words like "Theo Stealth", sentence starts) but **regex-based extraction is inherently noisy** — typically 5–15× more entries than canonical, with maybe 10–20% real catches. Tagged `source: prose` to distinguish; query with `/dm:dnd registry list --source prose` to manually review and prune. For high-quality prose extraction, the future move is LLM-backed (similar to `/dm:dnd graph extract`).

- `/dm:dnd registry list [--campaign C] [--type npc|pc] [--source canonical|prose]` — print all registry entries; filter by campaign-currently-active, type, or source.
- `/dm:dnd registry lookup <name>` — case-insensitive lookup; prints the full entry as JSON.
- `/dm:dnd registry check <name> [--json]` — check whether a proposed name collides with the registry. Exit 0 if unique, 1 if duplicate. Severity (`warn` default, `strict` opt-in via `<DND_CAMPAIGN_ROOT>/.name_registry_config.json`) controls whether duplicates are reported as warnings or hard refusals. Used by `/dm:dnd new`, `/dm:dnd character new`, `/dm:dnd npc <new>` procedures.
- `/dm:dnd registry add --name N --type npc|pc --campaign C --session N` — record a new entry manually (auto-called by `/dm:dnd npc rename` and the creation-time uniqueness hooks).
- `/dm:dnd registry retire --name N --campaign C [--replaced-by NEW]` — mark a name as no longer active in a campaign (auto-called by `/dm:dnd npc rename`).

The registry by default captures **canonical** characters (those in `npcs.md` / `npcs-full.md` / `characters/` / graph.json node names). Names that appear only in session-log prose (one-off mentions, throwaway NPCs, skill-check labels) are NOT registered by default — that's deliberate, to avoid banning common names because of incidental use. The `--include-prose` flag is opt-in for users who want the broader (noisier) view.

**Severity config:** create `~/.claude/dnd/.name_registry_config.json` with `{"severity": "strict"}` to make all duplicate detections refuse-by-default rather than warn-and-allow. Set to `"none"` to disable checks entirely (registry rebuild and rename still work).

---

## `/dm:dnd characters`
List all characters in global roster (`~/.claude/dnd/characters/`). Display: name, race/class/level, origin campaign, previous campaigns, last updated.

Characters players built themselves on the web (`/crea`, see *Web character creation* below) carry a `**Status:** da approvare` line: list those first, marked as pending. `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/char_create.py list` prints just them.

### Web character creation (`/crea`)

When the display is running, anyone can open `<display URL>/crea` (also linked from the login screen as *Crea un nuovo personaggio*) and build a **level-1, 2014-rules** character in a chat where Claude asks the questions one at a time — the same flow as `/dm:dnd character new`. That Claude runs with no tools, no files and no memory (`claude -p --tools ""`), and the server computes every number itself (modifiers, saves, skills, HP) and rolls the ability scores when the player asks to roll. At the end the player picks a PIN on the page. The sheet is written to the global roster with `**Status:** da approvare`, and the PIN is stored hashed in `~/.claude/dnd/characters/web-accounts.json` — never in the sheet. Nothing reaches a campaign until the DM imports it with `/dm:dnd character import <name>`. The site is public, so it is rate limited (per IP and per day; see `LIMITS` in `char_create.py`).

---

## `/dm:dnd roll <notation>`
Run `scripts/dice.py <notation>`. Display output verbatim. Examples: `d20`, `2d6+3`, `d20 adv`, `4d6kh3`.

---

## `/dm:dnd combat start`
1. Identify combatants; collect name, DEX mod, HP, AC, type (pc/npc) for each.
2. Run `combat.py init '<JSON>'` — auto-roll initiative for every combatant including PCs. Display tracker and per-combatant roll breakdown.
3. Send initiative to display:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/send.py << 'DNDEND'
   ⚔️ Initiative — Round 1
   [Name]: d20(N) + DEX = total
   Turn order: [Name] → [Name] → ...
   DNDEND
   ```
4. Push turn order to stats sidebar:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --turn-order '{"order":[...],"current":"FirstName","round":1}'
   ```
5. Save STATE_JSON to `state.md` under `## Active Combat`.
6. Step through turns using the per-turn sequence (in SKILL.md Active DM Mode).
7. On combat end: update HP in character sheets, clear `## Active Combat`, `push_stats.py --turn-clear`, narrate aftermath, send XP summary, run `tracker.py -c <campaign> clear`.

**XP awards** go in the final display send:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/send.py << 'DNDEND'
[combat aftermath narration]

⭐ XP Awarded
- [Enemy] defeated: N XP
- [Objective] completed: N XP
- Total: N XP ÷ [players] = N XP each
- [Name]: N / 300 XP | [Name]: N / 300 XP
DNDEND
```

---

## `/dm:dnd rest <short|long>`
**Short (1 hour):**
1. Ask how many Hit Dice the player spends. Roll `d[hit-die] + CON mod` per die via `dice.py`. Update HP, push `push_stats.py --player NAME --hp`.
2. Note class features that recharge (e.g. Second Wind → `push_stats.py --player NAME --second-wind true`).
3. Advance time: `calendar.py -c <campaign> rest short`
4. Clear encounter conditions: `tracker.py -c <campaign> clear` (concentration may persist — ask)

**Long (8 hours):**
1. Restore all HP, half max Hit Dice (round up), all spell slots, most class features. Update sheet.
2. Push: `push_stats.py --player NAME --hp <max> <max>` and `--second-wind true`.
3. Advance time: `calendar.py -c <campaign> rest long`
4. Clear all tracker state: `tracker.py -c <campaign> clear --all`
5. Update `state.md` in-world date to match calendar output.

---

## `/dm:dnd recap`
Read session-log.md. Deliver 3–5 sentence in-character narrator recap of the most recent session entry.

## `/dm:dnd pin [<fact> | list | remove <fact-or-number>]`

Manage the campaign's **Pinned Facts** — the soft, stable canon the table never wants forgotten. Pinned facts live in `state.md → ## Pinned Facts` and are read at every `/dm:dnd load` alongside `## DM Style Notes`, then kept hot for the whole session. They are the DM's long-term memory: things that don't fit Live State Flags (which track shifting state) because they don't change — a promise made, a dead sibling's name, an in-joke, a house rule, a detail the player has said matters.

- **`/dm:dnd pin <fact>`** — append `<fact>` as a new bullet under `## Pinned Facts` (replacing the *(none pinned yet)* placeholder if present). Confirm what was pinned. Keep each fact to one line; pin the fact, not a paragraph.
- **`/dm:dnd pin`** *(no args, mid-scene)* — when the player says "remember this" / "don't forget X" / "pin that", capture the fact they mean in one line and pin it as above, then acknowledge briefly in the fiction and move on.
- **`/dm:dnd pin list`** — read and print the current `## Pinned Facts` bullets.
- **`/dm:dnd pin remove <fact-or-number>`** — remove the matching bullet (by its text or its position in the list). If it leaves the section empty, restore the *(none pinned yet)* placeholder. Confirm the removal.

Pinned facts are never rewritten wholesale at `/dm:dnd save` the way Live State Flags are — they only change when the player pins or unpins one, or when one is corrected because it became wrong. A running account of *what happened* already lives in `session-log.md`, `## Recent Events`, and `## Continuity Archive` (queried via `/dm:dnd recap`); Pinned Facts is the separate, deliberately small set of things to always carry, not a second event log.

## `/dm:dnd world`
Read and display world.md.

## `/dm:dnd quests`
Read `state.md` → display Active Quests and Open Threads sections.

---

## `/dm:dnd arc [status|advance|revise|view]`

Manage the dynamic campaign arc. The `advance`/`revise`/`new` subcommands are active only when `state.md → ## Campaign Arc` has `type: dynamic` — no-op for sandbox campaigns. For **structured (imported)** campaigns, `status` and `view` read from `arc.md` (chapter advancement happens at `/dm:dnd save`, not here); `advance`/`revise`/`new` are no-ops.

- **`/dm:dnd arc`** or **`/dm:dnd arc status`** — print current act, current beat label, `what_changes` for the current beat, and `steering_notes`. Quick reference, one screen. (Structured: print `current_act`, `current_chapter`, current chapter's `key_beats`, and `outstanding_beats` from `state.md`; read `arc.md` only if more detail is asked for.)
- **`/dm:dnd arc advance [beat-id]`** — mark the named beat complete (current beat if omitted). Remove from `outstanding_beats`. Advance `current_beat` to the next pending beat. If all beats in an act are complete, advance `current_act`. Update `steering_notes` to describe how to reach the newly current beat without forcing it.

  **When the final beat (3b) is marked complete — arc continuation:**
  `outstanding_beats` is now empty. Ask: *"The arc is complete. Continue the campaign with a new arc? [y/n]"*
  - **Yes** → run `/dm:dnd arc new` (see below).
  - **No** → set `type: sandbox` and clear `outstanding_beats`. The campaign continues open-ended from the resolution state.

- **`/dm:dnd arc new`** — generate a new arc for a campaign that has completed its previous arc. Use Opus for this step.

  The new arc must be **intentionally distinct** — not a continuation of the same conflict, but a new chapter that grows from the changed world. The resolution of arc N is the status quo of arc N+1.

  Procedure:
  1. Read the completed arc's `resolution` field — this is now the world's baseline.
  2. Read `## DM Notes`, `## World State`, `## Faction Moves`, and any `## Continuity Archive` entries to understand what the world looks like post-resolution.
  3. Derive the new arc from **the consequences** of what just resolved. Ask: *what problem did solving the last arc create? What power vacuum formed? What did the party's victory cost that now has to be reckoned with? What was ignored because the last arc demanded all attention?*
  4. Generate a new full arc (theme, resolution, acts 1–3, 6 beats) using the same format as the initial arc. The new theme must be meaningfully different from the previous one — same world, new lens.
  5. Archive the completed arc: move the current `acts` block, `theme`, and `resolution` into a new `## Arc History` section in state.md under `arc_N` (numbered), with a one-line summary of how it resolved.
  6. Write the new arc to `## Campaign Arc`, incrementing `arc_number`. Set `current_act: 1`, `current_beat: "1a"`, `outstanding_beats` to all 6 beat ids.
  7. Append to `revision_log`: `"<date>: Arc N complete. New arc N+1 generated. [one-line premise of the new arc]"`
  8. Deliver a one-paragraph summary of the new arc's premise and how it differs from the previous one.

- **`/dm:dnd arc view`** — show full arc: theme, resolution, all acts and beats with completion status (current / complete / pending). If `## Arc History` exists, show a one-line summary of each completed arc above the current one.
- **`/dm:dnd arc revise`** — open revision flow for when the story has taken a major unexpected turn OR when the auto-trigger from /dm:dnd end's pre-emption check fires (most common case):
  1. Show all outstanding beats with their current `what_changes` and `world_pressure`.
  2. Ask: *"What's changed in the story that the arc doesn't reflect?"* — or, when auto-triggered by pre-emption, name the pre-empted beat directly: *"Beat 2b's pressure delivered but the consequence didn't land. Picking a revision path…"*
  3. **Apply one of three landing-path templates** (per SKILL.md rule 8) to the affected outstanding beat:
     - **Cost path** — `what_changes` becomes "the party paid a concrete cost for moving fast"; `world_pressure` becomes the specific cost (cover blown, ally compromised, position lost). Best when the party pre-empted cleanly.
     - **Secondary consequence path** — `what_changes` becomes "the world responded to being pre-empted in a way the party didn't anticipate"; `world_pressure` becomes the new escalation (the antagonist reads the disruption as a signal and does something WORSE). Best when the antagonist is intelligent and adaptive.
     - **Deferred path** — keep the original `what_changes` shape; rewrite `world_pressure` to a NEW pressure pointing at the same consequence, scheduled for the next 1–2 sessions. Best when the original consequence is still narratively essential and only the timing slipped.
  4. Rewrite `what_changes` (consequence-shaped per the rule in /dm:dnd new step 12) and `world_pressure` (event-shaped is fine) for the affected beat. Do NOT modify completed beats.
  5. Append to `revision_log`: `"<date>: <beat-id> — <path: cost/secondary/deferred> — <what changed and why — one sentence>"`
  6. Update `steering_notes` to describe the next session's expected delivery.
  7. Confirm what was revised. Show before/after for `what_changes` and `world_pressure`.

## `/dm:dnd graph <subcommand>` — campaign relationship graph

Local-only typed-edge relationship graph supplementing markdown. Stored at `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/graph.json`. Supplements `npcs-full.md` / `session-log.md` — does not replace them. Edges are time-stamped (`since_session` / `until_session`), so historical state is recoverable.

**Auto-pulled at `/dm:dnd load` step 5** (scene-context) and **swept at `/dm:dnd save`** (relationship-shift extraction). The DM also uses `/dm:dnd graph scene-context` on demand mid-session, especially before heavy social or political scenes.

For background reading on the design and the A/B replay study that motivated it, see `docs/research/graph/`.

All subcommands invoke `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/campaign_graph.py <subcommand> --campaign <name> [args]`.

### `/dm:dnd graph init [campaign-name]`
First-time bootstrap. Read existing `npcs.md` / `world.md` / `state.md` for the campaign. Propose a node list (NPCs as `npc_*`, factions as `faction_*`, key locations as `place_*`) and a starter edge list (faction membership from npcs.md tables, NPC location from "Lives in / Based at" fields, faction relationships from world.md). Display the proposed list to the DM and **ask for approval** before writing — do not silently extract. After approval, run `add-node` and `add-edge` for each. Use `--since` matching state.md's current session count.

For existing campaigns being initialized for the first time, the `/dm:dnd load` flow offers to back the campaign directory up first; honour that flow rather than running init from a cold prompt.

### `/dm:dnd graph add-node --type T --name N [--tags ...] [--summary ...]`
Add a single node. Type is open vocab; suggested: `npc`, `faction`, `place`, `item`, `thread`. Default id is `<type>_<name-slug>`.

### `/dm:dnd graph add-edge --from <id> --to <id> --type T [--since N] [--note ...]`
Add a typed edge between two existing nodes. Edge type is open vocab; common: `loyal_to`, `opposes`, `allied_with`, `member_of`, `lives_in`, `controls`, `knows_about`, `friends_with`, `lover_of`, `owes`, `rules`, `related_by_blood`, `advances_thread`, `blocks_thread`. Always supply `--since` (the current session number from state.md) so historical replay works.

### `/dm:dnd graph set-disposition --to <npc-or-faction> --level <L> [--since N] [--note ...]`
Type how the **party** stands toward an NPC or faction on the normalized scale `allied | friendly | neutral | suspicious | hostile` — the same five values the display's faction panel uses, so the graph and the sidebar speak one language. The edge runs from the shared `party` node (auto-created on first use) to the target; its type is inferred from the target — `disposition` for an NPC, `standing` for a faction — and it carries the `level`.

Single-valued and current: setting a new stance **closes** any prior active party→target stance edge at `--since` (its arc stays queryable with `--at-session <old N>`) and adds the new level, so `scene-context` only ever surfaces the party's *current* stance. `scene-context` renders it as `The Party --[disposition:suspicious]--> Aldric` so the stance reads at a glance. Always pass `--since <current-session-N>`.

Use it whenever the fiction shifts the party's standing — an NPC turns on them, a faction they wronged goes hostile, an alliance is earned. It is the graph-side counterpart to the `standing` values pushed to the display via `push_stats.py --factions` and to the NPC-disposition lines in `state.md → ## Live State Flags`; keep the three consistent when a stance changes.

### `/dm:dnd graph close-edge --id <edge-id> --at-session N`
Mark an edge as ended at session N (e.g. when an alliance breaks). Original edge is preserved with `until_session` set; it remains visible in historical queries but is excluded from "active at session ≥ N" results.

### `/dm:dnd graph list [--type T] [--at-session N]`
Print a compact node table grouped by type. With `--at-session`, also reports active edge count at that session.

### `/dm:dnd graph show --id <node-id>`
Print one node with all incoming and outgoing edges.

### `/dm:dnd graph scene-context --place <id> [--present id1,id2] [--threads id1,id2] [--hops H] [--at-session N]`
**Primary query for in-session use.** Returns a focused subgraph from the current scene (place + present NPCs + active threads) bounded by hop count, optionally filtered to edges active at a given session. Output is grouped: nodes by type, then a relationships block. Default `--hops 2`. Use this when you need to recall who-relates-to-whom in the current scene without re-reading `npcs-full.md` or session-log archives.

### `/dm:dnd graph subgraph --seed <id> [--seed <id>] [--hops H] [--at-session N]`
Lower-level traversal — same as `scene-context` but with arbitrary seed nodes. Use when the scene framing doesn't fit (e.g. tracing faction politics independent of any specific place).

### `/dm:dnd graph extract [campaign-name] [--last-session-only]`
Run a Haiku pass over the campaign's session-log to propose new edges with verbatim source-anchors. Outputs a proposal JSON to `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/graph-proposals-<date>.json` for human review. Does **not** write to graph.json — that's the apply step.

### `/dm:dnd graph extract --deterministic [--last-session-only] [--write FILE]`
**Zero-LLM alternative.** Pattern-matches session-log sentences against the bundled verb-table seed (`data/graph/verb_table_seed.yaml`) and emits the same proposal shape as the Haiku pass — no Claude API call, no cost, fully portable. Trades recall (~50%, clean subject-verb-object only) for precision (~95%) and determinism. Prints proposals to stdout, or writes them with `--write`.

### `/dm:dnd graph extract --deterministic --apply [--min-confidence low|medium|high] [--no-auto-nodes]`
One-shot auto-apply: run deterministic extraction and write proposals at/above `--min-confidence` (default `high`) straight into `graph.json` — deduped against existing edges and **idempotent** (re-running adds nothing new). Missing nodes are auto-created as `npc_*` placeholders unless `--no-auto-nodes` is set. Use this for a hands-off relationship sweep at `/dm:dnd save`; use the review path below when you want a human in the loop.

### `/dm:dnd graph extract-apply --proposals <file> [--pick N1,N2,...] [--review]`
Apply previously-extracted proposals (from either the Haiku or deterministic pass). Without `--pick`/`--review`, applies all. With `--pick`, applies only the listed proposal indices. With `--review`, walks proposals one at a time with y/n/q prompts.

### Suggested DM workflow

1. **First session after install:** `/dm:dnd load` will offer to initialize the graph (with a backup-first prompt). Accept; review the proposed seed; approve.
2. **During session:** when a relationship shifts in narration, run `/dm:dnd graph add-edge` (or `close-edge`) with `--since` set to the current session number. Don't batch this — record at the moment of the narrative change so you don't forget.
3. **Before a heavy social/political scene:** run `/dm:dnd graph scene-context --place <current-place> --present <key-NPCs>` to refresh which relationships matter right now.
4. **At `/dm:dnd save`:** review the session log and add any edges you missed during play (the save flow runs an automatic sweep and presents proposals for approval).

## `/dm:dnd oracle <subcommand>` — solo/improv oracle tools

Dice-driven oracles for improvised play — they keep pacing transparent and rollable instead of letting the DM invent every beat. All subcommands invoke `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/oracle.py <subcommand>`. Rolls are stdlib-random and seedable (`--seed N`) for reproducibility. Zero LLM calls.

### `/dm:dnd oracle chaos [--campaign N]`
Show the campaign's current **chaos factor** (Mythic-style, 1–9). 1 = the PCs are firmly in control; 9 = the world is spinning out from under them. Stored in `state.md → ## Session Flags` as `chaos_factor: N` (default 5).

### `/dm:dnd oracle chaos set --campaign N --value V`
Set the chaos factor to V (clamped 1–9) and persist it to `state.md`.

### `/dm:dnd oracle chaos adjust --campaign N (--pc-won | --pc-lost)`
Move the factor one step the standard Mythic direction: `--pc-won` (PC achieved the scene goal) → −1; `--pc-lost` (PC was reactive or failed) → +1. Adjust once per scene.

### `/dm:dnd oracle ask [--likelihood L] [--campaign N | --chaos C] [--seed S]`
Ironsworn-shaped **yes/no** oracle. Likelihood ∈ {`sure-thing`, `likely`, `50/50`, `unlikely`, `no-way`} (default `50/50`); the chaos factor (read from the campaign, or `--chaos`) shifts the odds. Returns a verdict — `yes`/`no` optionally suffixed `-and` (extreme, on doubles) or `-but` (qualified, near the threshold) — plus the d100. Use when the fiction poses a question the prep doesn't answer.

### `/dm:dnd oracle event [--seed S]`
Mythic **Random Event Focus** (d100). Returns a direction label (`new NPC`, `NPC action`, `move toward thread`, `PC negative`, etc.) — interpret it against the campaign's current threads, NPCs, and locations. Use when a scene needs an unexpected turn.

### `/dm:dnd oracle scene [--seed S]`
Two-word **scene-meaning** generator (action verb + subject noun, One Page Solo Engine). Use as a spark when narration runs dry or an event focus rolls. Interpret loosely.

## `/dm:dnd recap` — precomputed party state-diff

Deterministic state-diff between two character snapshots — `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/session_recap.py`. Recaps are the #1 thing an LLM hallucinates (wrong HP, dropped facts); this computes the change set from data so narration never has to. Reads the character sheets at `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/characters/*.md` and merges live `tracker.json` conditions/concentration. Zero LLM calls.

### `/dm:dnd recap snapshot --campaign N`
Snapshot the party's current state (HP/temp/level/hit dice/death saves/conditions/concentration/exhaustion/inspiration/spell slots) to `~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/.recap/`. Rolls the previous `last.json` to `prev.json` so the next diff has a baseline. **Take a snapshot at `/dm:dnd end`** so the next session's load can diff against it.

### `/dm:dnd recap diff --campaign N [--before FILE] [--after FILE]`
Diff the prior snapshot against the current state and print a one-paragraph plain-English summary (e.g. *"Aldric: took 18 damage (30→12 HP); gained Poisoned; spent 2 level 1 slots."*). With no `--before`, uses the stored `prev`/`last` snapshot; with no `--after`, snapshots live state on the fly. **Inject this line at `/dm:dnd load`** as the mechanical half of the recap. `--json` emits the structured change list.

---

## `/dm:dnd tutor on` / `/dm:dnd tutor off`
Toggle tutor/learning mode. Write `tutor_mode: true/false` to `state.md` under `## Session Flags`. Session-scoped — does not persist to next `/dm:dnd load` unless explicitly set again. (Full tutor mode behavior is in SKILL.md.)

---

## `/dm:dnd autorun on` / `/dm:dnd autorun off`

Toggle autorun (taxi) mode — Claude drives the turn loop automatically when players submit via the display companion. No PTY wrapper required.

**On:**
1. Write `autorun: true` to `state.md → ## Session Flags`.
2. **Check Bash permissions** — read `~/.claude/settings.json`. If `permissions.allow` does not include `"Bash"` (or `"Bash(*)"` or similar), add it automatically:
   - Read the file, merge `"Bash"` into `permissions.allow`, write it back.
   - Tell the DM: *"Added Bash to permissions.allow in ~/.claude/settings.json — autorun won't prompt for each wait. Restart this session for it to take effect if it doesn't immediately."*
   - If it was already present, skip silently.
3. Confirm to the DM: *"Autorun enabled. Players submit via the display; I'll pick up each action automatically. Send me a message at any time to take control of a turn."*
4. If the user specified an interval (e.g. `/dm:dnd autorun on 45`), write `autorun_interval: 45` to `state.md → ## Session Flags`. Default is 60 if omitted.
5. Immediately enter the autorun wait (see SKILL.md for the Bash block). If there's already something in `.input_queue`, pick it up as the current turn's player action.

The display shows a pie-clock countdown draining from full to empty over the interval. Green pulse = actively waiting. Configurable via `autorun_interval: N` in state.md (default 60 seconds).

**Off:**
1. Write `autorun: false` (or remove the line) to `state.md → ## Session Flags`.
2. Confirm: *"Autorun disabled. Back to manual mode — press Enter or tell me to submit when players are ready."*
3. Do NOT start the autorun wait after this response.

**Check on `/dm:dnd load`:** If `autorun: true` is present in state.md, tell the DM autorun is active and begin the wait loop after the recap paragraph.

**When NOT to run the autorun wait (even if flag is set):**
- Mid-combat, resolving a specific combatant's turn
- Waiting on a player dice roll result
- The DM just sent a message (they're driving this turn)
- During `/dm:dnd save`, `/dm:dnd end`, or any command response

## `/dm:dnd autosave on` / `/dm:dnd autosave off`

Toggle the behind-the-scenes continuity checkpoint. Writes `autosave: on|off` to `state.md → ## Session Flags`. **Default is on.** Applies to every campaign type (structured, dynamic, sandbox) — it only ever writes the same continuity anchors a normal save writes, just more often, and never changes narration.

**What autosave does when on:**
1. **In-model micro-saves** (always available, no setup): the DM silently flushes continuity at scene boundaries and on a turn cadence — see the *Continuity micro-save* rule in SKILL.md. This keeps unsaved state near zero so a context compaction costs nothing.
2. **Deterministic Stop-hook checkpoint** (optional, opt-in): if the user has installed the hook, `autosave_checkpoint.py` snapshots `state.md` every turn and prompts a micro-save every N turns. Install once with:
   ```bash
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/install_autosave_hook.py        # enable
   python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/install_autosave_hook.py --uninstall
   ```
   The hook reads this same `autosave` flag, so `/dm:dnd autosave off` silences it without uninstalling.

**On:** write `autosave: on`. Confirm: *"Autosave on — I'll checkpoint continuity behind the scenes so a context compaction never loses your place."*

**Off:** write `autosave: off`. Confirm: *"Autosave off — I'll only persist on /dm:dnd save and /dm:dnd end."*

**Why turn-count, not a context percentage:** the model cannot see its own context-usage level, so there is no reliable "save at 80% full" trigger from inside the skill. The cadence is keyed on turns instead, tuned to fire well before auto-compaction.
