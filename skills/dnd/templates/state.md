## Pinned Facts
*Soft facts the DM always keeps — canon the table never wants forgotten. Read at every /dnd load alongside DM Style Notes and kept hot all session. Unlike Live State Flags (which track shifting state and are rewritten each save), pinned facts are stable and are only added or removed on request. Pin a promise made, a dead sibling's name, a running in-joke, a table house rule, a detail the player has said matters. Add/list/remove with `/dm:dnd pin`.*
*(none pinned yet)*

## Arc History
*(populated by /dnd arc new when a completed arc is succeeded by a new one — one entry per completed arc)*
*(leave empty until the first arc completes)*

## Session Flags
*(tutor_mode, autorun, autorun_interval, tts_voice, sfx_languages, autosave, absent — session-scoped flags set via /dnd commands or by the display companion)*
*(absent: PCs whose player isn't at the table this session, or `none` — asked fresh at every /dm:dnd load. Benched PCs are left off the sidebar and out of scenes, but still receive XP.)*
*(autosave: on|off — default on. Governs the behind-the-scenes continuity checkpoint (Live State Flags + graph + session tail). Toggle with /dm:dnd autosave on|off.)*
